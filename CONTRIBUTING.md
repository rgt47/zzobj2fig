# Contributing to zzobj2fig

Thank you for your interest in contributing. This document describes the
expected workflow for proposing changes, reporting issues, and submitting
pull requests.

## Reporting issues

Before opening an issue, please search existing issues at
<https://github.com/rgt47/zzobj2fig/issues> to confirm the problem has
not already been reported. When opening a new issue, include:

- A minimal reproducible example (a `reprex::reprex()` is preferred).
- The output of `sessionInfo()`.
- The version of zzobj2fig in use (`packageVersion('zzobj2fig')`).
- The expected behaviour and the observed behaviour.
- For LaTeX-rendering issues, the relevant excerpt of the `.log` file
  produced by `pdflatex`.

## Proposing a change

For non-trivial changes, please open an issue first to discuss the
approach. This avoids duplicate work and lets us flag scope or
compatibility concerns early.

## Pull request workflow

1. Fork the repository and create a topic branch off `main`.
2. Install development dependencies. zzobj2fig uses `renv`; restore the
   pinned environment with:
   ```r
   renv::restore()
   ```
3. Make your changes. Keep commits focused; prefer many small commits
   over one large one.
4. Add or update tests in `tests/testthat/`. New exported functions
   require tests.
5. Run `devtools::document()` to regenerate `man/` and `NAMESPACE`.
6. Run the full check locally:
   ```r
   devtools::check()
   ```
   The check must pass with no errors, warnings, or notes other than
   the standard 'New submission' note. If you do not have a local LaTeX
   distribution, run inside the project Docker container instead:
   ```bash
   make docker-check
   ```
7. Update `NEWS.md` with a one-line bullet under the unreleased section.
8. Open a pull request against `main`. Reference any related issues.

## Coding style

- Use the native R pipe (`|>`); avoid `%>%` in new code.
- Use `<-` for assignment, never `=`.
- Use `snake_case` for functions and variables.
- Prefer implicit returns; reserve `return()` for early exits.
- Document all exported functions with `roxygen2`. Each must have
  `@title`, `@description`, `@param`, `@return`, and `@examples`.
- Two-space indentation. Single quotes for character literals.
- Do not add 'what' comments. Reserve comments for non-obvious 'why'.

## Tests

Tests use `testthat` 3rd edition. Run with:

```r
devtools::test()
```

LaTeX-dependent tests are skipped automatically when `pdflatex` is not
on `PATH`; they will be exercised in CI.

For coverage reports:

```r
covr::package_coverage()
```

## Vignettes

If your change affects user-facing behaviour, update the corresponding
vignette in `vignettes/`. Vignettes that produce PDF output are not
committed; only the `.Rmd` source is tracked. Verify the vignette
builds:

```r
devtools::build_vignettes()
```
